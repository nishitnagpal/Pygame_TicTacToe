# Tic - Tac - Toe
Game that we all love to play when bored, be it on paper, online, social media or on walls even. Using Pygame - a Python library - I wrote a basic code and styled it a bit with size and colour adjustments. 

The game offers players the option to either play against the computer or with a friend. I have designed the "Play with Computer" mode such that the computer algorithm strategically predicts the best moves to block the opponent and to win the game. At the conclusion of the game, a win message is displayed, and then the game resets, allowing player to play again.

GitHub Pages primarily supports static content such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Pygame, however, is a Python library that requires a Python interpreter to run, which GitHub Pages does not support natively. Firstly, I created an index.html file to include a canvas for drawing the game and a script reference. Then restructured the Python application using JavaScript. I used HTML5 Canvas for drawing and basic JavaScript for the game logic.
